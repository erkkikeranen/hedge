This plugin is is companion plugin for Hedge. Hedge is a platform agnostic
Clojurescript Framework for ring compatible serverless function handlers.

This plugin makes usage of Hedge easier. Serverless Framework is used to handle
deployment and this plugin creates build instructions for Hegde and invokes
Hedge to build requested handler when requested by user.

Secondary target of the plugin is to improve development agility by enabling
local function testing.
